# PRD Structure

## Problem Statement

- Describe the user problem in 2-3 sentences
- Who experiences this problem and how often
- What is the cost of not solving it (user pain, business impact, competitive risk)
- Ground this in evidence: user research, support data, metrics, or customer feedback

## Goals

- 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes this feature should achieve
- Each goal should answer: "How will we know this succeeded?"
- Distinguish between user goals (what users get) and business goals (what the company gets)
- Goals should be outcomes, not outputs ("reduce time to first value by 50%" not "build onboarding wizard")

## Non-Goals

- 3-5 things this feature explicitly will NOT do
- Adjacent capabilities that are out of scope for this version
- For each non-goal, briefly explain why it is out of scope (not enough impact, too complex, separate initiative, premature)
- Non-goals prevent scope creep during implementation and set expectations with stakeholders

## User Stories

Write user stories in standard format: "As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"

Guidelines:
- The user type should be specific enough to be meaningful ("enterprise admin" not just "user")
- The capability should describe what they want to accomplish, not how
- The benefit should explain the "why" — what value does this deliver
- Include edge cases: error states, empty states, boundary conditions
- Include different user types if the feature serves multiple personas
- Order by priority — most important stories first

Example:
- "As a team admin, I want to configure SSO for my organization so that my team members can log in with their corporate credentials"
- "As a team member, I want to be automatically redirected to my company's SSO login so that I do not need to remember a separate password"
- "As a team admin, I want to see which members have logged in via SSO so that I can verify the rollout is working"

## Requirements

**Must-Have (P0)**: The feature cannot ship without these. These represent the minimum viable version of the feature. Ask: "If we cut this, does the feature still solve the core problem?" If no, it is P0.

**Nice-to-Have (P1)**: Significantly improves the experience but the core use case works without them. These often become fast follow-ups after launch.

**Future Considerations (P2)**: Explicitly out of scope for v1 but we want to design in a way that supports them later. Documenting these prevents accidental architectural decisions that make them hard later.

For each requirement:
- Write a clear, unambiguous description of the expected behavior
- Include acceptance criteria (see below)
- Note any technical considerations or constraints
- Flag dependencies on other teams or systems

## Open Questions

- Questions that need answers before or during implementation
- Tag each with who should answer (engineering, design, legal, data, stakeholder)
- Distinguish between blocking questions (must answer before starting) and non-blocking (can resolve during implementation)

## Timeline Considerations

- Hard deadlines (contractual commitments, events, compliance dates)
- Dependencies on other teams' work or releases
- Suggested phasing if the feature is too large for one release
