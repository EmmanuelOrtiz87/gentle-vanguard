# Reference: Rationalizations, Red Flags & Verification

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                      | Reality                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "It's working, no need to touch it"                  | Working code that's hard to read will be hard to fix when it breaks. Simplifying now saves time on every future change.                               |
| "Fewer lines is always simpler"                      | A 1-line nested ternary is not simpler than a 5-line if/else. Simplicity is about comprehension speed, not line count.                                |
| "I'll just quickly simplify this unrelated code too" | Unscoped simplification creates noisy diffs and risks regressions in code you didn't intend to change. Stay focused.                                  |
| "The types make it self-documenting"                 | Types document structure, not intent. A well-named function explains _why_ better than a type signature explains _what_.                              |
| "This abstraction might be useful later"             | Don't preserve speculative abstractions. If it's not used now, it's complexity without value. Remove it and re-add when needed.                       |
| "The original author must have had a reason"         | Maybe. Check git blame — apply Chesterton's Fence. But accumulated complexity often has no reason; it's just the residue of iteration under pressure. |
| "I'll refactor while adding this feature"            | Separate refactoring from feature work. Mixed changes are harder to review, revert, and understand in history.                                        |

## Red Flags

- Simplification that requires modifying tests to pass (you likely changed behavior)
- "Simplified" code that is longer and harder to follow than the original
- Renaming things to match your preferences rather than project conventions
- Removing error handling because "it makes the code cleaner"
- Simplifying code you don't fully understand
- Batching many simplifications into one large, hard-to-review commit
- Refactoring code outside the scope of the current task without being asked

## Verification Checklist

After completing a simplification pass:

- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Build succeeds with no new warnings
- [ ] Linter/formatter passes (no style regressions)
- [ ] Each simplification is a reviewable, incremental change
- [ ] The diff is clean — no unrelated changes mixed in
- [ ] Simplified code follows project conventions (checked against CLAUDE.md or equivalent)
- [ ] No error handling was removed or weakened
- [ ] No dead code was left behind (unused imports, unreachable branches)
- [ ] A teammate or review agent would approve the change as a net improvement
