# Red Flags

- Deprecated systems with no replacement available
- Deprecation announcements with no migration tooling or documentation
- "Soft" deprecation that's been advisory for years with no progress
- Zombie code with no owner and active consumers
- New features added to a deprecated system (invest in the replacement instead)
- Deprecation without measuring current usage
- Removing code without verifying zero active consumers
- A schema change and the code that depends on it shipped in the same deploy
- A column renamed or dropped in place rather than via expand/contract
- A migration merged with no tested down path, or a backfill that locks the table

# Verification

## After deprecation

- [ ] Replacement is production-proven and covers all critical use cases
- [ ] Migration guide exists with concrete steps and examples
- [ ] All active consumers have been migrated (verified by metrics/logs)
- [ ] Old code, tests, documentation, and configuration are fully removed
- [ ] No references to the deprecated system remain in the codebase
- [ ] Deprecation notices are removed (they served their purpose)

## After database schema migration

- [ ] The change ships in additive phases (expand → backfill → contract), not a single in-place edit
- [ ] Old and new code are both valid against the schema at every deploy step
- [ ] Each migration has a tested down path; backfills run in throttled batches
- [ ] Destructive steps (drop/rename) ship in their own deploy after no code references the old shape
