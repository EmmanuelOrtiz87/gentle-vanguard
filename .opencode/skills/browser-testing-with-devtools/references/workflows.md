# Debugging Workflows

## For UI Bugs

```
1. REPRODUCE
   └── Navigate to the page, trigger the bug
       └── Take a screenshot to confirm visual state

2. INSPECT
   ├── Check console for errors or warnings
   ├── Inspect the DOM element in question
   ├── Read computed styles
   └── Check the accessibility tree

3. DIAGNOSE
   ├── Compare actual DOM vs expected structure
   ├── Compare actual styles vs expected styles
   ├── Check if the right data is reaching the component
   └── Identify the root cause (HTML? CSS? JS? Data?)

4. FIX
   └── Implement the fix in source code

5. VERIFY
   ├── Reload the page
   ├── Take a screenshot (compare with Step 1)
   ├── Confirm console is clean
   └── Run automated tests
```

## For Network Issues

```
1. CAPTURE
   └── Open network monitor, trigger the action

2. ANALYZE
   ├── Check request URL, method, and headers
   ├── Verify request payload matches expectations
   ├── Check response status code
   ├── Inspect response body
   └── Check timing (is it slow? is it timing out?)

3. DIAGNOSE
   ├── 4xx → Client is sending wrong data or wrong URL
   ├── 5xx → Server error (check server logs)
   ├── CORS → Check origin headers and server config
   ├── Timeout → Check server response time / payload size
   └── Missing request → Check if the code is actually sending it

4. FIX & VERIFY
   └── Fix the issue, replay the action, confirm the response
```

## For Performance Issues

```
1. BASELINE
   └── Record a performance trace of the current behaviour

2. IDENTIFY
   ├── Check Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   ├── Check Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   ├── Check Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
   ├── Identify long tasks (> 50ms)
   └── Check for unnecessary re-renders

3. FIX
   └── Address the specific bottleneck

4. MEASURE
   └── Record another trace, compare with baseline
```

## Writing Test Plans for Complex UI Bugs

For complex UI issues, write a structured test plan the agent can follow in the browser:

```markdown
## Test Plan: Task completion animation bug

### Setup

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks
2. Ensure at least 3 tasks exist

### Steps

1. Click the checkbox on the first task
   - Expected: Task shows strikethrough animation, moves to "completed" section
   - Check: Console should have no errors
   - Check: Network should show PATCH /api/tasks/:id with { status: "completed" }

2. Click undo within 3 seconds
   - Expected: Task returns to active list with reverse animation
   - Check: Console should have no errors
   - Check: Network should show PATCH /api/tasks/:id with { status: "pending" }

3. Rapidly toggle the same task 5 times
   - Expected: No visual glitches, final state is consistent
   - Check: No console errors, no duplicate network requests
   - Check: DOM should show exactly one instance of the task

### Verification

- [ ] All steps completed without console errors
- [ ] Network requests are correct and not duplicated
- [ ] Visual state matches expected behaviour
- [ ] Accessibility: task status changes are announced to screen readers
```

## Screenshot-Based Verification

Use screenshots for visual regression testing:

```
1. Take a "before" screenshot
2. Make the code change
3. Reload the page
4. Take an "after" screenshot
5. Compare: does the change look correct?
```

This is especially valuable for:

- CSS changes (layout, spacing, colours)
- Responsive design at different viewport sizes
- Loading states and transitions
- Empty states and error states

## Console Analysis Patterns

### What to Look For

```
ERROR level:
  ├── Uncaught exceptions → Bug in code
  ├── Failed network requests → API or CORS issue
  ├── React/Vue warnings → Component issues
  └── Security warnings → CSP, mixed content

WARN level:
  ├── Deprecation warnings → Future compatibility issues
  ├── Performance warnings → Potential bottleneck
  └── Accessibility warnings → a11y issues

LOG level:
  └── Debug output → Verify application state and flow
```

### Clean Console Standard

A production-quality page should have **zero** console errors and warnings. If the console isn't
clean, fix the warnings before shipping.

## Accessibility Verification with DevTools

```
1. Read the accessibility tree
   └── Confirm all interactive elements have accessible names

2. Check heading hierarchy
   └── h1 → h2 → h3 (no skipped levels)

3. Check focus order
   └── Tab through the page, verify logical sequence

4. Check colour contrast
   └── Verify text meets 4.5:1 minimum ratio

5. Check dynamic content
   └── Verify ARIA live regions announce changes
```
