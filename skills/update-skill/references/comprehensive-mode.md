# Comprehensive Mode (`--comprehensive`) — Extra Steps

Everything in Default Mode, plus a deep scan of recent activity.

### 1. Scan Activity Sources

Gather data from available MCP sources:

- **Chat:** Search recent messages, read active channels
- **Email:** Search sent messages
- **Documents:** List recently touched docs
- **Calendar:** List recent + upcoming events

### 2. Flag Missed Todos

Compare activity against TASKS.md. Surface action items that aren't tracked:

```
## Possible Missing Tasks

From your activity, these look like todos you haven't captured:

1. From chat (Jan 18):
   "I'll send the updated mockups by Friday"
   → Add to TASKS.md?

2. From meeting "Phoenix Standup" (Jan 17):
   You have a recurring meeting but no Phoenix tasks active
   → Anything needed here?

3. From email (Jan 16):
   "I'll review the API spec this week"
   → Add to TASKS.md?
```

Let user pick which to add.

### 3. Suggest New Memories

Surface new entities not in memory:

```
