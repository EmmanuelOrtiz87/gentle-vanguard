# Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks,
fast iteration

**2. Inline Execution** — Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, batch execution with
checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
- Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review

**If Inline Execution chosen:**

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:executing-plans
- Batch execution with checkpoints for review
