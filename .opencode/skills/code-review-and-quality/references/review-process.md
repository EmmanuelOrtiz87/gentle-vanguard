# Review Process

## Step 1: Understand the Context

Before looking at code, understand the intent:

- What is this change trying to accomplish?
- What spec or task does it implement?
- What is the expected behavior change?

## Step 2: Review the Tests First

Tests reveal intent and coverage:

- Do tests exist for the change?
- Do they test behavior (not implementation details)?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Do tests have descriptive names?
- Would the tests catch a regression if the code changed?

## Step 3: Review the Implementation

Walk through the code with the five axes in mind:

For each file changed:

1. Correctness: Does this code do what the test says it should?
2. Readability: Can I understand this without help?
3. Architecture: Does this fit the system?
4. Security: Any vulnerabilities?
5. Performance: Any bottlenecks?

## Step 4: Categorize Findings

Label every comment with its severity so the author knows what's required vs optional:

| Prefix                        | Meaning            | Author Action                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(no prefix)_                 | Required change    | Must address before merge                               |
| **Critical:**                 | Blocks merge       | Security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:**                      | Minor, optional    | Author may ignore — formatting, style preferences       |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion         | Worth considering but not required                      |
| **FYI**                       | Informational only | No action needed — context for future reference         |

This prevents authors from treating all feedback as mandatory and wasting time on optional
suggestions.

**Lead with what matters.** Order findings by leverage: correctness and security first, then
structural regressions and missed simplifications, then everything else. Don't bury a real issue
under cosmetic nits — a few high-conviction comments beat a long list. If you have one structural
problem and ten nits, the structural problem _is_ the review.

## Step 5: Verify the Verification

Check the author's verification story:

- What tests were run?
- Did the build pass?
- Was the change tested manually?
- Are there screenshots for UI changes?
- Is there a before/after comparison?

## Multi-Model Review Pattern

Use different models for different review perspectives:

```
Model A writes the code
    │
    ▼
Model B reviews for correctness and architecture
    │
    ▼
Model A addresses the feedback
    │
    ▼
Human makes the final call
```

This catches issues that a single model might miss — different models have different blind spots.

**Example prompt for a review agent:**

```
Review this code change for correctness, security, and adherence to
our project conventions. The spec says [X]. The change should [Y].
Flag any issues as Critical, Required, Optional, or Nit.
```

## Dead Code Hygiene

After any refactoring or implementation change, check for orphaned code:

1. Identify code that is now unreachable or unused
2. List it explicitly
3. **Ask before deleting:** "Should I remove these now-unused elements: [list]?"

Don't leave dead code lying around — it confuses future readers and agents. But don't silently
delete things you're not sure about. When in doubt, ask.

```
DEAD CODE IDENTIFIED:
- formatLegacyDate() in src/utils/date.ts — replaced by formatDate()
- OldTaskCard component in src/components/ — replaced by TaskCard
- LEGACY_API_URL constant in src/config.ts — no remaining references
→ Safe to remove these?
```

## Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review:

**Before adding any dependency:**

1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit`)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new dependencies. Every dependency is
a liability.

**Upgrading an existing dependency** is a code change like any other, and the riskiest upgrades are
the ones merged in bulk with a message like "bump deps." Review them with the same discipline:

1. **Read the changelog, not just the version number.** Semver is a promise the maintainer may not
   have kept — a "patch" can carry a behavioral change. For a major bump, read the migration notes
   and find what breaks.
2. **One dependency per change.** Upgrade and merge them individually (or in small related groups).
   When a bulk bump breaks the build, you've lost which package did it; a single-package change
   makes the cause obvious and the revert clean.
3. **Let the tests decide.** The upgrade is verified by a green suite before _and_ after, not by "it
   installed." If coverage around the dependency's behavior is thin, that gap is the real finding —
   add a test first.
4. **Mind the transitive graph.** Most installed packages are ones nobody chose directly. Review the
   lockfile diff, not just `package.json`; a single direct bump can pull in dozens of indirect
   changes.
5. **Keep the lockfile honest.** Commit it, review its diff, and never hand-edit it. The lockfile is
   the thing that actually pins what ships.

For triaging `npm audit` findings and supply-chain risk (typosquatting, compromised maintainers),
follow the `security-and-hardening` skill — this section covers the upgrade _workflow_, that one
covers the security verdict.

## Delegation Triggers

Based on Gentle AI workflow guidance, these triggers direct agent behavior:

| Trigger                                              | Expected Behavior                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading 4+ files to understand a flow                | Delegate to exploration agent or run an exploration phase                               |
| Touching 2+ non-trivial files                        | Use one focused writer and validate the result                                          |
| Implementation ready for review                      | Start bounded native review that freezes candidate and creates content-bound receipt    |
| Commit, push, or PR                                  | Validate same receipt against live Git candidate; never silently reopen review          |
| Long monolithic session with accumulating complexity | Pause and delegate, re-plan, or justify why not                                         |
| Wrong cwd, worktree/git accident, merge recovery     | Stop, preserve review scope, investigate or validate existing receipt before proceeding |

## Receipt and Gate Binding

The review system binds receipts to Git candidates to protect against scope/identity drift:

1. **Create Receipt** — When review completes, generate receipt bound to current Git SHA
2. **Validate on Delivery** — Before commit/PR, validate receipt matches live Git state
3. **Staged Index** — For focused reviews, use `git add <path>` then review staged only
