# Error-Specific Patterns — Full Reference

---

## Test Failure Triage

```
Test fails after code change:
├── Did you change code the test covers?
│   └── YES → Check if the test or the code is wrong
│       ├── Test is outdated → Update the test
│       └── Code has a bug → Fix the code
├── Did you change unrelated code?
│   └── YES → Likely a side effect → Check shared state, imports, globals
└── Test was already flaky?
    └── Check for timing issues, order dependence, external dependencies
```

---

## Build Failure Triage

```
Build fails:
├── Type error → Read the error, check the types at the cited location
├── Import error → Check the module exists, exports match, paths are correct
├── Config error → Check build config files for syntax/schema issues
├── Dependency error → Check package.json, run npm install
└── Environment error → Check Node version, OS compatibility
```

## Runtime Error Triage

```
Runtime error:
├── TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
│   └── Something is null/undefined that shouldn't be
│       → Check data flow: where does this value come from?
├── Network error / CORS
│   └── Check URLs, headers, server CORS config
├── Render error / White screen
│   └── Check error boundary, console, component tree
└── Unexpected behavior (no error)
    └── Add logging at key points, verify data at each step
```
